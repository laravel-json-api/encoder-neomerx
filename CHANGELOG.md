## Unreleased

### Added
- [#2](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/encoder-neomerx/pull/2)
New `withRequest` method on the encoder, allows a request to be passed into the encoding process.
This is then provided to each `JsonApiResource` object when it is being encoded. This change
was made to bring the resource into line with Laravel's Eloquent resource, which is passed the
request when serializing models. *(Changes to classes in the `Schema` namespace to implement this
are considered non-breaking, as they are internal classes.)*
- Resource meta can now contain conditional attributes, as the conditional iterator is used when
processing meta returned by the `JsonApiResource` class.

### Fixed
- [#3](https://github.com/laravel-json-api/encoder-neomerx/issues/3)
Add missing package discovery configuration to `composer.json`.

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] - 2021-01-25
